# ATM project

Skipped part: I haven't done unit testing before, therefore I skipped a few unit test such as for the DialPad and NumberField element, the two screens and the app component, because I was not completely sure how this were supposed to be tested.

## Available Scripts


To run the project first run:

### `npm install`

and then

### `npm start`

inside the project folder.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test -a`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

## Coin data

The list of coins are located in the data.js folder.
